To execute the provided Python script on a newly installed machine (Ubuntu server for example), you will need to install several Python packages. Based on the script, the required packages include:

numpy: For numerical operations.
pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
matplotlib: For plotting and visualization.
scikit-learn (sklearn): For machine learning algorithms and data preprocessing.
torch (PyTorch): For tensor operations, which are essential for the Fuzzy ARTMAP (FAM) implementation.
ucimlrepo: For fetching datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
To install these packages, you can use the following pip commands:

pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn torch ucimlrepo
Additionally, since the script is intended to be run in a Jupyter Notebook environment (as indicated by the file name Additionally, since the script is intended to be run inML Model Comparison KNearest-FAM.ipynb), you might also consider installing Jupyter if you plan to use this environment. Jupyter can be installed using:

pip install jupyter
After installing Jupyter, you can launch a Jupyter Notebook server with:


System Requirements
Ensure that your Ubuntu server has Python 3 installed. If not, you can install Python 3 using the following command:

sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3
sudo apt install python3-pip

Running the Script
After installing all required packages, copy the script into a Python file (e.g., script.py) or a Jupyter Notebook, and then run it in your preferred environment.

Additional Considerations
For a server environment, especially if it's a headless server (no GUI), you might encounter issues with matplotlib if it attempts to use GUI-based backends. You can avoid this by configuring matplotlib to use a non-interactive backend like Agg.
The torch package might have specific version requirements depending on your system's hardware, especially if you intend to use GPU acceleration. Make sure to check PyTorch's official installation guide for compatible versions.
